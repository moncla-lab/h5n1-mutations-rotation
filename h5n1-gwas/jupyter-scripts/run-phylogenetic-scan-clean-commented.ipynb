    "# Run phylogenetic scan for mutations enriched in different hosts\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook contains commands to load the necessary dependencies, and perform the gene-wide scan for mutations enriched in different host species. The way I've structured this code is by coding the actual computational components of the method into other scripts/documents, and then simply calling them here. My intention is that this should avoid making edits to the underlying code, and instead altering parameters like the number of simulated iterations, the input tree, required counts, etc... The real heft of the method is coded in 2 other notebooks: `calculate-enrichment-scores` and `simulate-mutation-gain-loss-markov-chain`. This notebook will read those notebooks in, and run them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of this method is to identify mutations that are enriched in different host species. The premise is that if mutations are adaptive/beneficial in a given host species, then that mutation should be found more commonly in one host species than the other. In this project, we are trying to find mutations that are responsible for human adaptation of H5N1 viruses, so our host comparison is between humans and birds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing mutations across host species can be accomplished by simply looking at an alignment, but using a tree-based approach has many benefits. For one, in an alignment, there is no information about how sequences/samples are related to each other. Using a tree-based approach allows you to control for associations based on related samples and to specifically look for independent patterns of recurrent mutations. It allows you to run controls for population structure/sampling, which are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, you first enumerate every single mutation that occurs on the phylogenetic tree, and count how many times that mutation is found in the hosts you want to query. Here, for each mutation on the tree, we record how many times it occurs on the tree and how many human and bird tips it is associated with. Because we are not reconstructing ancestral states onto internal nodes on the phylogeny, mutations that arise on nodes are not assigned a host state. Instead, we trace the path from that node to all its descendants, and record tips that have retained that mutation. For each mutation, we then construct a 2x2 contingency table: \n",
    "\n",
    "|host|presence|absence|\n",
    "|:------|:-------|:------|\n",
    "|host 1|A|B| \n",
    "|host 2|C|D|\n",
    "\n",
    "where A, B, C, and D are counts of the mutation's presence and absence in host 1 and host 2. Based on the methodology [here](https://github.com/sheppardlab/pGWAS/blob/master/assomap_given_phylo.py), published in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07368-7#Sec10) and detailed in lines 245-273 in the code, you can then calculate an odds ratio, describing the degree of association of a particular mutation with a particular host as: `OR = (A * D)/(B * C)`. You can take this one step further and use this 2x2 table to calculate a Fisher's exact test p-value. When you run a fisher's exact test in python, it will output 2 values: an odds ratio and a p-value. The odds ratio output is exactly equivalent to the odds ratio calculated here. For testing purposes, this code currently calcules an odds ratio and p-value by fishers exact test for each mutation. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the first part of the procedure, you then have a list of every mutation on the tree, it's counts in human and avian tips, an odds ratio, and a p-value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A huge, recurring issue for phylogenetic-based methods, and for GWAS methods, is sampling and population structure. There are lots of instances, for example, where a single mutation will be present in a large cluster of human tips, resulting in a large odds ratio. However, we can't be sure that this mutation was not in the avian population from which these humans were infected, because sampling is incomplete. It could absolutely be true that this mutation resulted in a virus more able to infect people, but it could also be in this human cluster simply because in this outbreak, only humans were sampled. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to control for this issue is to evaluate how skewed counts among these hosts are assuming no selection at all. For example, if we placed mutations onto the tree randomly, with no underlying selection, how frequently would we see ones that are significantly enriched in one host or the other by the odds ratio? By definition, these associations would be due to chance alone. We can then use this \"null distribution\" to find examples in our true tree that are more skewed than we see in this random, null. To do this, we take the tree and strip it of its mutations. We then simulate a single mutation that toggles on and off on the tree and count how many times it is found in human and avian tips as above. For each simulated tree, we calculate the same odds ratio and p-value. We do this many times to generate a distribution of odds ratios and p-values in these simulated datasets. We can then use these distributions as null distributions, and take the most extreme 5% as our cutoff for statistical significance. "
