    "# Simulate mutation gain and loss as a markov chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Based off methodology described in [Pascoe et al](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13051) and [Sheppard et al](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1305559110)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will construct a null distribution for the enrichment scores calculate in `calculate-enrichment-scores-across-tree`. To do so, we want to simulate the gain and loss of mutations as a random process that occurs across the tree. We will do this following the methodology outlined in Pascoe et al. Currently, the way I am doing this is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with the tree in JSON format, make a copy of the tree object. \n",
    "2. On that copy, delete all existing mutations. Retain the tree's structuree (branch lengths, topology, tips) \n",
    "3. On that empty tree, traverse from root to tip. At each branch, evaluate whether to randomly add a mutation or not. This is evaluated probablistically as: `probability no mutation = (1.0+exp(-2.0*branch_length*rate))/2.0`, where `rate = 1/total_tree_branch_length`. This is exactly the same as what was described by Sheppard et al and is in his code. \n",
    "4. Perform a random draw of a number between 0 and 1. If that number is less than `probability no mutation`, do not mutate. If greater than, do mutate. \n",
    "5. If mutate, determine whether this is a gain of mutation or loss of mutation. To do this, we need to find the current state. To do so, traverse back up the tree to find the most recent ancestral node at which there is a mutation. If there is none, then our current state is unmutated, and this event is a gain eventt. If the current state is mutated, then this event will be a loss event. \n",
    "4. Add the proper mutation. Either a wild type to mutant (W1M) or mutant to wild type (M1W). Add this as an amino acid mutation on the tree. \n",
    "5. Return the simulated tree. Calculate enrichment score as: \n",
    "\n",
    "|host|presence|absence|\n",
    "|:------|:-------|:------|\n",
    "|host 1|A|B| \n",
    "|host 2|C|D|\n",
    "\n",
    "where A, B, C, and D are counts of the mutation's presence and absence in host 1 and host 2. The odds ratio is then calculated as: `OR = (A * D)/(B * C)`"
