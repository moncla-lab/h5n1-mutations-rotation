# README

This repository contains code for developing GWAS methods for finding mutations associated with host switching on H5N1 phylogenies. This is very much work in progress, with surely many bugs at this point.

Jupyter notebooks converted to python files with the following variables now defined in config.py:
  * tree_path
  * host_annotation
  * gene
  * host1
  * host2
  * minimum_required_count
  * method
  * iterations
